        <strong>Žemaičių blynai</strong>, and the name translates to Samogitian pancakes. These flat potato pancakes are made from eggs, salt, and coarsely mashed, riced, or grated potatoes, and they're filled with carrots or meat. The filling is often made with diced pork, eggs, and pepper.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h3>For the pancakes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cooked potatoes</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp potato starch</li>
        <li>200g diced pork</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>100g bacon, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp flour</li>
        <li>¼ tsp pepper, pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Oil for frying.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Method</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Cook the potatoes in their skins in salted water, cool until you can handle them, then peel the skin off.</p></li>
        <li><p>Rice, mash or grate the potatoes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add one egg, potato starch, and salt to taste.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix with a wooden spoon, then when the egg is absorbed, knead with your hands until the mixture is no longer sticky.</li>
        <li><p>You can knead it on a board with a little additional flour, but too much will affect the taste.</p></li>    
    </ol>
    <h3>To prepare the filling</h3>
    <ol>
    
        <li><p>Simmer the diced pork in a little salted water for about 10 minutes, until cooked. Skim the scum off the water, drain, then process the meat until it is finely minced. Her mother used to grate the cooked meat which, shreds it very finely.</p></li>
    
        <li><p>Heat a little oil in a pan and slowly cook half the finely chopped onion until translucent. Mix in the meat and the other egg to bind. Season with salt to taste and a good sprinkling of pepper.</p></li>

        <li><p>Pat each piece of potato dough into a circle, place a teaspoon of filling in the centre, and fold the pancake over to enclose it, pressing the edges together. They will be an oval shape. Dip in flour and cook in a little hot oil in a frying pan until golden brown on each side.</p></li>
    
        <li><p>Cook the bacon and the rest of the onion in a little oil.</p></li>

        <li><p>Serve the pancakes with the bacon and onion mix and a dollop of sour cream.</p></li>
