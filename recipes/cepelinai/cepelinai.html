    </ol>
    <h3>For the Dumplings</h3>
    <ol>

        <li><p>lace them in a fine-mesh cheesecloth or cotton dishtowel, and twist over a large bowl to get rid of the excess water.</li></p>
        <li><p>our off the water, reserving the potato starch at the bottom of the bowl.</li></p>
        <li><p>Unwrap the cheesecloth and place the raw potatoes in the bowl with the potato starch you reserved from the bottom of the bowl.</li></p>
