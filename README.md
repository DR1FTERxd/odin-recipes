My first odin project 
I have not too much skill in web development, my first recipe it was not easy. Forgot some minor things bet everything went smoothly.
And the end, overall it was fun, but my project stopped. Because of my "git push" erroe took few hours to find the fix for it after that, it was an hour of work to finishing
